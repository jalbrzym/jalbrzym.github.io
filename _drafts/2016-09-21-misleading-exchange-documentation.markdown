### Hello Exchange!

A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to work with on-premise Exchange Server 2013. Microsoft provides an interface to communicate with Exchange called EWS Managed API v2.0.

### Language choice

Why I decided to write in English?

- I want to reach a wider audience and exchange experiences with developers from all over the world.

- I think that English is a *lingua franca* in IT world. I read a lot of books and e-books in English version (Polish translations are terrible). I use documentations and specifications written in English. It's often easier for me to express my thoughts about software engineering in English than in my native language.

- Polish is primary language using in communication in the company I work for. This results from the fact that [ITMAGINATION](http://itmagination.pl/en) is a Polish company and most of employees are Poles. Those who are not, at the beginning they usually use English, but in the meantime they try to learn Polish (and they do it very well!). Of course, it is easier and faster to speak in native language, but I would like increase my English skills. *Practice makes perfect*.

### Blogging platform

Out of all the blogging platforms I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is a static site generator, easy to configure and deploy. Jekyll doesn't use database and can be hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Posts are created using Markdown syntax, which simplifies a process of text-formatting and allows me completely focus on content.

### Further steps

I hope that this post is not the last. The first step is always the hardest, but I've made it. Now it's high time to start blogging!
